# Elegant React Tooltip

A simple tooltip component that automatically positions itself and provides a seamless user experience.

Just wrap your elements with the **elegant-react-tooltip** and it will automatically show the tooltip in the right position.

Features:
- determine position
- consider the window width (no tooltips will be cut off at the edge of the screen)
- convenient timing: there's a bit of delay before the first tooltip would appear, but then the next ones appear immediately once the mouse moves over another item

## Installation and usage
The easiest way to use elegant-react-tooltip is to install it from npm or yarn and build it into your app:

```
npm install elegant-react-tooltip
```
or
```
yarn add elegant-react-tooltip
```
